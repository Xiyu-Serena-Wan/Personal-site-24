            <p>I was born and raised in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bejing, China.</span> 
                In my teenage years, I was very fortunate to be in a very liberal art school, <span style="font-weight: bold;">BNDS</span>. 
                This place planted many seeds in my heart which were growing and blossoming since.
                I arrived in the states in Aug. 2022. Life in the states expanded my horizon. 
                I did some amazing project and am becoming the person I always wanted to be. 
            </p>
            <p>Now, I have my own newsletter and blog. 
                I work for the first ultimate media in China called Pan Donut part-time.I am also a sport product manager. 
                In 2023, my work included bringing the most famous athlete in frisbee to China and helped launch his product in China.
                I also have my own fan group, where I post frisbee content. I do code-related projects for a living. Here is my com-sci <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b3bZMeRWOA6Tq7unMJMghsNvRw29iddp/view?usp=sharing">resume</a>.
